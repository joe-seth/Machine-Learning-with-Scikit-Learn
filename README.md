# Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-Learn
The "Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-Learn" series is a collection of Python notebooks that aim to explore and experiment with various aspects of machine learning. The project starts with an introduction to data manipulation using Pandas and Numpy, using the "Car_sales" dataset as a sample. Following this, it delves into machine learning, tackling a binary classification problem of heart disease prediction. Subsequently, the project scales up to regression problems, specifically predicting the cost of houses in California using the "sklearn.load_data" dataset.

This series of notebooks demonstrates the step-by-step process of building and evaluating machine learning models, showcasing the essential techniques and tools required for successful data analysis and prediction.

# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Introduction
In the realm of healthcare and data science, predicting heart diseases using machine learning has emerged as a critical area of research and application. Heart disease prediction leverages the power of data and algorithms to assess the risk factors associated with cardiovascular health.

## Problem Statement
The primary objective of the heart disease prediction project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately determining whether a patient has a heart disease or not. This problem is framed as a binary classification task, where the model classifies patients into two categories: those with heart disease and those without.

## Data Preprocessing
Before diving into the heart disease prediction task, it is essential to prepare the data for analysis. Data preprocessing involves cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming features. In this project, Pandas and Numpy are used to manipulate the data efficiently.

### Car Sales Dataset
To build a foundation in data manipulation, the project begins by working with a small sample dataset called "Car_sales." This dataset serves as a practical exercise to familiarize oneself with Pandas and Numpy, key tools for data preprocessing in machine learning.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
Once the groundwork with data preprocessing is completed, the project advances to the heart disease prediction task. Various machine learning algorithms are explored to build a robust predictive model. Commonly used algorithms include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbors, among others.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering plays a vital role in enhancing the predictive power of the model. This phase involves selecting relevant features, creating new ones if necessary, and normalizing or scaling them for consistent performance. The quality of features greatly influences the model's accuracy.

# California Housing Price Prediction Regression Problem
## Introduction
In the domain of real estate and housing market analysis, predicting housing prices is a valuable application of machine learning. The California housing price prediction problem focuses on estimating the cost of houses in different regions of California.

## Problem Statement
The central objective of this regression problem is to build a machine learning model that can predict the prices of houses in California based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more. Unlike the heart disease prediction, this problem is framed as a regression task, aiming to predict numerical values (house prices) rather than binary classifications.

## Data Loading and Exploration
To start addressing the California housing price prediction challenge, the project begins with loading and exploring the dataset. Understanding the dataset's structure and characteristics is crucial for making informed decisions during the model-building process.

### sklearn.load_data Dataset
In this project, the dataset used for predicting California housing prices is sourced from `sklearn.datasets.load_data`. This dataset provides valuable insights into housing market trends in different regions of California, making it a suitable choice for regression analysis.

## Machine Learning for Regression
Regression problems require distinct algorithms and techniques compared to classification tasks. In this section of the project, various regression algorithms are employed to develop a model capable of accurately predicting housing prices. Common regression algorithms include linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and gradient boosting, among others.

## Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning
To ensure the model's reliability and accuracy, it is essential to evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Hyperparameter tuning is also performed to optimize the model's parameters and achieve the best predictive results.
